# IMedia_Pizzaria-Fontenelle

PIZZARIA FONTENELLE

Project developed in the CSS3 course from Imedia Brasil on Udemy's platform. It consists of the homepage of a fictional pizzeria.

This course was very useful to learn the commands: transition, transform, position, object fit and media queries.

I have already used many of the resources I learned in this project in my own projects and in my portfolio.
